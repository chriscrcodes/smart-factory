# MQTT Data Simulator

This project simulates publishing data to an MQTT broker using Python. It reads a configuration file that defines the topics, tags, and other settings, generates simulated data, and publishes it to MQTT topics at regular intervals.

## Overview

The **MQTT Data Simulator** is designed to simulate data publishing to an MQTT broker. It generates random or predefined data based on a JSON configuration file, then sends the data to MQTT topics at a specified interval.

This simulator can be useful for testing IoT applications, MQTT brokers, or any system that relies on MQTT messaging.

---

## Features

- **MQTT Protocol v5** support.
- Simulated data generation based on mean and deviation or constant values.
- TLS support for secure connections.
- Supports multiple data types, including `int`, `float`, `boolean`, `datetime`, `string`, and `guid`.
- Customizable through a JSON configuration file.
- Real-time data publishing with timestamps in UTC.

---

## Prerequisites

Before you can run the simulator, make sure you have the following installed:

- **Python 3.x** (Tested with Python 3.7+)
- **Paho MQTT Python Client** (`paho-mqtt`)
- **Colorama** (for terminal colors)
- **PyFiglet** (for the ASCII banner)

Install the necessary Python dependencies:

```bash
pip install paho-mqtt colorama pyfiglet
```

---

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository** or copy the script to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repository/mqtt-data-simulator.git
   cd mqtt-data-simulator
   ```

2. **Install the dependencies** as mentioned in the [Prerequisites](#prerequisites) section.

3. Place your configuration file (`mqtt_config.json`) in the same directory as the script.

---

## Configuration

The MQTT Data Simulator reads its configuration from a JSON file. Below is a sample configuration structure:

```json
{
    "mqtt_broker": {
        "address": "broker.hivemq.com",
        "port": 1883,
        "username": "your_username",
        "password": "your_password",
        "use_tls": false
    },
    "root_topic": "LightningCars",
    "topics": [
        {
            "topics": [
                "LightningCars/Berlin/Stamping/Line1/1A2B3C"
            ],
            "tags": [
                { "tag": "GoodPartsCount", "type": "int", "mean": 95, "deviation": 5 },
                { "tag": "ScrapPartsCount", "type": "int", "mean": 5, "deviation": 1 },
                { "tag": "PlannedProductionTime", "type": "float", "mean": 2400, "deviation": 0 },
                { "tag": "MachineStatus", "type": "boolean" },
                { "tag": "QualityStatus", "type": "boolean" },
                { "tag": "Timestamp", "type": "datetime" }
            ]
        }
    ],
    "publish_interval": 5
}
```

### Configuration Fields

- **mqtt_broker**: Contains information to connect to the MQTT broker.
  - `address`: The MQTT broker address (e.g., `broker.hivemq.com`).
  - `port`: Port for MQTT (default: `1883`).
  - `username` & `password`: Optional credentials for authentication.
  - `use_tls`: Boolean to indicate if TLS should be used.
  
- **root_topic**: The base topic to which subtopics will be appended.
  
- **topics**: A list of topics and corresponding data tags to publish.
  - `topics`: The list of subtopics to append to the root topic.
  - `tags`: A list of data tags to generate for each topic. Each tag specifies:
    - `tag`: The name of the data field.
    - `type`: The data type (`int`, `float`, `boolean`, `datetime`, `string`, `guid`).
    - `mean` & `deviation`: The mean and deviation (for numerical data).
    - `constant`: A constant value if no randomness is needed.

- **publish_interval**: Time in seconds between data publications (default: `5` seconds).

## How It Works

The simulator reads the configuration file, connects to the MQTT broker, and repeatedly generates and publishes data to the specified MQTT topics.

### Key Components

- **load_config**: Loads the configuration from the JSON file.
- **generate_data**: Generates random or predefined data for each tag based on its type and mean/deviation.
- **publish_data**: Publishes the generated data to the MQTT topics.
- **connect_mqtt**: Connects to the specified MQTT broker using the provided settings (TLS, credentials, etc.).

### Data Generation

Data is generated based on the tag configuration:
- If a **constant** value is defined, it is used directly.
- For numerical data (`int`, `float`, `double`), a value is randomly generated within a range defined by `mean Â± deviation`.
- **Boolean** data is randomly chosen as either `True` or `False`.
- **Datetime** data is generated as the current UTC timestamp.
- **String** data is generated randomly (e.g., `SampleString_45`).
- **GUID** data is generated as a unique UUID.

### Publishing Data

The simulator constructs the full MQTT topic by appending subtopics to the `root_topic` and adds a **Timestamp** and **Location** to the data payload. The payload is then published as a JSON object to the MQTT broker.

## Running the Simulator

1. Place the `mqtt_config.json` configuration file in the same directory as the Python script.
2. Run the script:

   ```bash
   python mqtt_data_simulator.py
   ```

3. The simulator will start publishing data based on the configuration, and you will see output like this:

   ```
   2024-10-09T13:00:00Z - Published data to topic 'LightningCars/Berlin/Stamping/Line1/1A2B3C': {'GoodPartsCount': 95, 'ScrapPartsCount': 5, 'PlannedProductionTime': 2400, 'MachineStatus': True, 'QualityStatus': True, 'Timestamp': '2024-10-09T13:00:00Z', 'Location': 'LightningCars/Berlin/Stamping/Line1/1A2B3C'}
   ```

---

## Customizing the Simulator

You can customize the simulator by modifying the **mqtt_config.json** file to suit your specific requirements. Key areas for customization include:
- **Adding new topics**: Add more topics under the `topics` section.
- **Adjusting tag values**: Modify the `mean` and `deviation` values to control data randomness.
- **Using TLS**: Enable `use_tls` and provide the necessary certificate files for secure connections.
- **Authentication**: Set `username` and `password` for brokers that require authentication.
